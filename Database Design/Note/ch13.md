**Specialization  / Generalization:** Most useful additional data modeling concept of  Enhanced ER (EER) model.

Associated with superclasses, subclasses, and the process of attribute inheritance.

**Superclass:** An entity type that includes one or more distinct  subgroupings of its occurrences. 包含出现的不同的子组

**Subclass: **A distinct subgrouping of occurrences of an  entity type 一个实体类型的不同的子组

A subclass with more than one superclass is called  a ***<font size="4">shared subclass</font>***.

An entity and its subclasses, and their subclasses,  and so on, is called a ***<font size="4">type hierarchy</font>***.

**<font size="4">Generalization process:</font>**

* Process of ***<font color="brown">identifying their common  characteristics</font>*** among entities.

* Results in the identification of a ***<font color="brown">generalized  superclass</font>*** from the original entity types.

**<font size="4">Specialization process:</font>**

* Process of ***<font color="brown">maximizing differences</font>*** between  members of an entity by identifying their  distinguishing characteristics.

* Defining a set of superclasses first, then by defining  differences between members of an entity, related ***<font color="brown">subclasses</font>*** are identified.

***<font size="4">Participation constraint:</font>***
* Determines **whether** every member in superclass  **must participate** as a member of a subclass.
* Represented as ***<font color="red" size="4">{Mandatory}</font>*** and ***<font size="4" color="red">{Optional}</font>*** respectively.

***<font size="4">Disjoint constraint:</font>***

* Describes relationship between members of the  subclasses as whether **overlapping exists** 

  子类成员与父类的关系是否能重复出现

* Indicates whether member of a superclass can  be a member of one ***<font color="red" size="4">{Or}</font>*** , or more than one,  subclass ***<font color="red" size="4">{And}</font>***
